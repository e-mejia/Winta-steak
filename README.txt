Task tracker
PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT: This is a React task tracking application that can be used to keep track of one's tasks.

How's it made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Using the core technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript as the foundation, and using the popular Javascript Library, React, I built a task tracking application for everday tasks.

The following components make up the app:

Header
Todoform
Todolist
Footer
and the following files are used to style the markup:

App.css
Todo.css
Todoform.css
The app also uses React hooks, useState, useEffect and useRef. The app uses a Universally Unique Identifier or UUID function to create unique IDs for mapping andkeeping track of each task.

Optimizations
No app is ever perfect. And I plan to improve it at some point. Most likely adding localStorage to the mix.

Lessons Learned:

The use of hooks in functional components as well as working with props was a joy to work with. It furthered helped deepen my understanding of these concepts. But of course, there is always room to further learn and improve.
